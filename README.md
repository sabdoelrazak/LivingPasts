# Taste of Time 
As a project for the Living Pasts course at the Utrecht University, we from the Taste of Time team decided that it is time to delve into the dusty, old cookbooks to discover forgotten traditional Dutch recipes. Our goal is to show how these recipes are still as delicious today as they were back in the day and show YOU how to make them! On our website you will find articles on the ancient Dutch cuisine, recipes from the olden days, and videos on how to recreate those recipes yourself. Thank you for visiting our website and enjoy our delicious recipes!
